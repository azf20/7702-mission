## Implementation Considerations

Wallets have a range of decisions to make as they offer EIP-7702 support.

### Smart Account Contract Selection
Wallets need to choose a smart account contract implementation. As well as the usual "build or buy" decision, considerations include:
- Functionality requirements
- Security features
- Chain deployment strategy
- Gas optimization

### Delegation UX
A new EOA presents some decisions for the wallet in terms of user experience:
- Opt-in vs opt-out approach
- Chain-specific vs wallet-wide delegation
- Transaction handling (relayed vs user-signed)

### Smart Account UX
Once an EOA has an EIP-7702 delegation, wallets can potentially offer significantly enhanced user experiences, such as transaction batching, gas and chain abstraction and granular account permissions.
- Basic EIP-5792 integration
- Paymaster support
- Sub-accounts
- Session keys
- [Additional features to be determined]
